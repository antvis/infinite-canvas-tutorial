# An Infinite Canvas Tutorial

What is an Infinite Canvas? The term "infinite" in [infinitecanvas] is described as follows:

-   High scalability. Users can freely organize content structures in a non-linear fashion.
-   Zooming. Emulates the "zoom in" to get an overview and "zoom out" to observe details as in the real world.
-   Direct manipulation. Provides intuitive editing capabilities for basic shapes, including moving, grouping, and modifying styles.

The [infinitecanvas] showcases numerous examples ranging from design tools to creative boards, including some well-known products such as: [Figma], [Modyfi], [rnote], [tldraw], [excalidraw] and so on.

As a front-end developer, I am very interested in the rendering technologies involved. Although tldraw, excalidraw, and others generally use more user-friendly technologies like Canvas2D/SVG, there are also many editors and design tools in the JS and Rust ecosystems that use more low-level rendering technologies for 2D graphics with GPU acceleration to achieve better performance and experience:

-   [Figma] uses a tile-based rendering engine written in C++, compiled into WASM and then calls WebGL for rendering.
-   [Modyfi] uses [wgpu] from the Rust ecosystem, also compiled into WASM and then calls WebGL2 for rendering.
-   [Zed] uses GPUI to render rectangles, shadows, text, images, and other UI elements.
-   [Vello] and [xilem] experimentally use Compute Shader for 2D rendering.

Therefore, in this tutorial, I hope to implement the following features:

-   Use [@antv/g-device-api] as a hardware abstraction layer, supporting WebGL1/2 and WebGPU.
-   Referencing [mapbox] and [Figma], attempt to use tile-based rendering.
-   Use SDF (Signed Distance Field) rendering for circles, ellipses, rectangles, etc.
-   GPU-accelerated text and Bezier curve rendering.
-   Use [rough.js] to support hand-drawn styles.
-   Use CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) to support collaborative [Yjs].

Let's get started!

## Getting Started

The course project uses pnpm workspace, so you need to install pnpm first.

```bash
pnpm i
```

After entering the course directory, run [vite]:

```bash
cd packages/lesson_001
pnpm run dev
```

## Lesson 1 - Initialize canvas

-   A hardware abstraction layer based on WebGL1/2 and WebGPU.
-   Canvas API design.
-   Implementing a simple plugin system.
-   Implementing a rendering plugin based on the hardware abstraction layer.

## Lesson 2 - Draw a circle

-   Adding shapes to the canvas.
-   Drawing a circle using SDF.
-   Anti Aliasing.
-   Dirty flag design pattern.

## Lesson 3 - Scene graph and transform

-   Transformations. Make shapes support pan, zoom, rotate, and skew transformations.
-   Scene graph.

## Lesson 4 - Camera

-   What is a Camera?
-   Projection transformation.
-   Camera transformation.
-   Camera animation. Using Landmark transition between different camera states.

## Lesson 5 - Grid

-   Drawing straight lines using Line Geometry or screen-space techniques.
-   Drawing dots grid.

## Lesson 6 - Event System

-   Implement an event system compatible with DOM Event API.
-   How to pick a circle.
-   Implement a drag-and-drop plugin based on our event system.
-   Support for pinch zoom gestures.

## Lesson 7 - Web UI

-   Developing Web UI with Lit and Shoelace
-   Implementing a canvas component
-   Implementing a zoom toolbar component

# Lesson 8 - Optimize performance

-   What is a draw call
-   Reducing draw calls with culling
-   Reducing draw calls by combining batches
-   Using spatial indexing to improve pickup efficiency
