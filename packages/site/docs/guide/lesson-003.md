# Lesson 3 - Scene graph and transform

In the last lesson we drew a circle, in this lesson you will learn the following:

-   Transformations. Make shapes support pan, zoom, rotate, and skew transformations.
-   Scene graph.

Finally, we will use the above features to realize a simple model of the Solar System.

```js eval code=false
(async () => {
    const { Canvas, Circle, Group } = Lesson3;
    const canvas = await Utils.createCanvas(Canvas, 400, 400);

    const solarSystem = new Group();
    const earthOrbit = new Group();
    const moonOrbit = new Group();

    const sun = new Circle({
        cx: 0,
        cy: 0,
        r: 100,
        fill: 'red',
    });
    const earth = new Circle({
        cx: 0,
        cy: 0,
        r: 50,
        fill: 'blue',
    });
    const moon = new Circle({
        cx: 0,
        cy: 0,
        r: 25,
        fill: 'yellow',
    });
    solarSystem.appendChild(sun);
    solarSystem.appendChild(earthOrbit);
    earthOrbit.appendChild(earth);
    earthOrbit.appendChild(moonOrbit);
    moonOrbit.appendChild(moon);

    solarSystem.position.x = 200;
    solarSystem.position.y = 200;
    earthOrbit.position.x = 100;
    moonOrbit.position.x = 100;

    canvas.appendChild(solarSystem);

    let id;
    const animate = () => {
        solarSystem.rotation += 0.01;
        earthOrbit.rotation += 0.02;
        canvas.render();
        id = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();

    unsubscribe(() => {
        cancelAnimationFrame(id);
        canvas.destroy();
    });
    return canvas.getDOM();
})();
```

## Transform

[CSS Transform] provides these transform: `translate` `scale` `rotate` and `skew`.
The matrices behind these transformations can be found in [Transformations - LearnOpenGL]. Since our scene contains only 2D graphics, we only need a 3x3 matrix, and since the last row of `[0, 0, 1]` is fixed, we actually only need to store 6 elements of the matrix:

```bash
| a | c | tx|
| b | d | ty|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
```

We add a `transform` attribute to our graph base class directly using [@pixi/math], or of course [gl-matrix].

```ts
import { Transform } from '@pixi/math';

export abstract class Shape {
    transform = new Transform();
}
```

Before adding more methods, let's introduce an important concept.

### Local and world coordinates

Coordinate systems can be used to describe the position, rotation, and scaling of objects in a scene; the best known coordinate system is the Euclidean coordinate system. In graphics we also use the center of gravity coordinate system. Euclidean space can contain up to N dimensions, here we will only use two dimensions.

When we say "the moon revolves around the earth", we are actually ignoring objects other than the earth. In the moon's local coordinate system, it simply rotates around a point, even though in the world coordinate system of the entire solar system, the earth still rotates around the sun, and the moon ultimately follows the complex trajectory described above.

The concepts of local and world coordinate systems can be used in both 2D and 3D worlds. The image below from [playcanvas] shows the world coordinate system on the left, and you can see that the axes are always the same. The right side shows the local coordinate system of the cube, whose axes change as the object is transformed (in this case rotated), so if at this point this rotated object undergoes a translation in the positive direction of the X-axis (in red), it may run off the ground.

![local space and world space](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_6ae20b/afts/img/A*kgaHRIYex8MAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)

The world coordinate system is shared by all nodes in the scene graph, so it has a fixed origin `(0, 0)`, and the orientation of the XYZ axes (XY axes in the 2D scene) are fixed, even if the box in the scene rotates itself, the world coordinate system will not change for it. But for its own local coordinate system, its origin is no longer `(0, 0)` but the position of the object itself, and the axes naturally change, as the name suggests, it is associated with the object itself.

Imagine that the box is moved "10 units along the X-axis (red)", which has a completely different meaning in a different coordinate system. Therefore, when we want to transform an object, we first have to specify the coordinate system in which it is located.

In addition, the local coordinate system is also called **model coordinate system**, which is more convenient when describing the transformation of the model itself. If we want to make each soldier turn his head, it is obviously easier to do it in the local coordinate system, because the transformation "turn" is relative to the head of each model.
![local space and world space](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_6ae20b/afts/img/A*9B4FRo4UbNsAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ)

We add methods for transformations in local and world coordinate systems to the graph base class, provided in [@pixi/math]:

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get localTransform(): Matrix {
        return this.transform.localTransform;
    }
    get worldTransform(): Matrix {
        return this.transform.worldTransform;
    }
}
```

The following figure from [Fundamentals of Computer Graphics 4th Edition] shows the local (object) coordinate system being transformed by a model transformation to the world coordinate system, then by a camera transformation to the camera coordinate system, then by a projection transformation to the clipping coordinate system (clip space/NDC), and finally by a viewport Then the camera transform to the camera coordinate system, then the projection transform to the clipping coordinate system (clip space/NDC) and finally the viewport transform to the screen coordinate system (screen/pixel space). We will introduce the camera later, for now we only need to care about the model transformation.

![coordinates](/coordinates.png)

Next we need to pass the model transformation matrix into the shader to transform the vertex positions.

### Alignment

In the Vertex Shader the model transformation matrix is passed in via Uniform and then left-multiplied with the position vector:

```glsl
layout(std140) uniform ShapeUniforms {
  mat3 u_ModelMatrix;
};

vec2 position = (u_ModelMatrix * vec3(a_Position + a_Size * a_FragCoord, 1)).xy;
```

Naturally, we create a `Float32Array` of length 9 (a matrix of 3 \* 3) directly:

```ts
this.#uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({
    viewOrSize: Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT * 9, // mat3
    usage: BufferUsage.UNIFORM,
    hint: BufferFrequencyHint.DYNAMIC,
});
```

But then the console will report an error that the Uniform Buffer we created is not long enough, what's going on?

```bash
[.WebGL-0x10800c78f00] GL_INVALID_OPERATION: It is undefined behaviour to use a uniform buffer that is too small.
```

Here we need to introduce the concept of [Memory layout], Uniform Block supports `packed` `shared` `std140` `std430` layout rules. Different layout rules will lead to different ways of storing and reading data in the buffer. The advantage of choosing `std140` is that there are no layout differences between Programs (compared to `packed`), and there are no differences between OpenGL implementations (compared to `shared`), but the disadvantage is that you need to deal with alignment manually, and the documentation on the official website gives a warning about this, reminding us that we should try to avoid `vec3` in order to circumvent the alignment:

> Warning: Implementations sometimes get the std140 layout wrong for vec3 components. You are advised to manually pad your structures/arrays out and avoid using vec3 at all.

So what is alignment? Let's take `vec3` as an example, which is `4 * 3` Bytes long but actually takes up 16. In practice the alignment rules are very complex, and here `mat3` actually takes `4 * 12` Bytes of storage:

```ts
this.#uniformBuffer = device.createBuffer({
    viewOrSize: Float32Array.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT * 12, // mat3
    usage: BufferUsage.UNIFORM,
});
```

We need to manually add padding when writing data:

```bash
| a | c | tx|
| b | d | ty|
| 0 | 0 | 1 |
| padding | padding | padding |
```

```ts
const PADDING = 0;
const { a, b, c, d, tx, ty } = this.worldTransform;
this.#uniformBuffer.setSubData(
    0,
    new Uint8Array(
        new Float32Array([
            a,
            b,
            0,
            PADDING,
            c,
            d,
            0,
            PADDING,
            tx,
            ty,
            1,
            PADDING,
        ]).buffer,
    ),
);
```

It's worth noting that the same [Alignment of Uniform and Storage buffers] is available in WGSL, and there's [bytemuck] in the Rust ecosystem to help automate alignment, the following example is from [bevy]:

```rust
use bytemuck::{Pod, Zeroable};

#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Pod, Zeroable)]
pub struct UiMaterialVertex {
    pub position: [f32; 3],
    pub uv: [f32; 2],
    pub border_widths: [f32; 4],
}
```

Let's add translation APIs such as translation, rotation and zoom to the graphics.

### Translation

[WebGL 2D Translation]

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get position(): ObservablePoint {
        return this.transform.position;
    }
    set position(value: IPointData) {
        this.transform.position.copyFrom(value);
    }

    get x(): number {
        return this.position.x;
    }
    set x(value: number) {
        this.transform.position.x = value;
    }

    get y(): number {
        return this.position.y;
    }
    set y(value: number) {
        this.transform.position.y = value;
    }
}
```

Usage is consistent with PIXI.js:

```js eval code=false
circle = call(() => {
    const { Circle } = Lesson3;
    return new Circle({
        cx: 100,
        cy: 100,
        r: 50,
        fill: 'red',
    });
});
```

```js eval code=false
positionX = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'position.x', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval code=false
positionY = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'position.y', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval
call(() => {
    circle.position.x = positionX;
    circle.position.y = positionY;
});
```

```js eval code=false
(async () => {
    const { Canvas } = Lesson3;
    const canvas = await Utils.createCanvas(Canvas, 200, 200);
    canvas.appendChild(circle);

    let id;
    const animate = () => {
        canvas.render();
        id = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();

    unsubscribe(() => {
        cancelAnimationFrame(id);
        canvas.destroy();
    });
    return canvas.getDOM();
})();
```

### Rotation

Rotation, scaling, and skew require that the transform center be specified, similar to `transform-origin` in CSS:

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get pivot(): ObservablePoint {
        return this.transform.pivot;
    }
    set pivot(value: IPointData) {
        this.transform.pivot.copyFrom(value);
    }
}
```

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get rotation(): number {
        return this.transform.rotation;
    }
    set rotation(value: number) {
        this.transform.rotation = value;
    }
}
```

```js eval code=false
circle2 = call(() => {
    const { Circle } = Lesson3;
    return new Circle({
        cx: 0,
        cy: 0,
        r: 50,
        fill: 'red',
    });
});
```

```js eval code=false
pivotX = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'pivot.x', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval code=false
pivotY = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'pivot.y', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval
call(() => {
    circle2.pivot.x = pivotX;
    circle2.pivot.y = pivotY;
});
```

```js eval code=false
(async () => {
    const { Canvas } = Lesson3;
    const canvas = await Utils.createCanvas(Canvas, 200, 200);
    canvas.appendChild(circle2);

    let id;
    const animate = () => {
        circle2.rotation += 0.01;
        canvas.render();
        id = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();

    unsubscribe(() => {
        cancelAnimationFrame(id);
        canvas.destroy();
    });
    return canvas.getDOM();
})();
```

### Scaling

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get scale(): ObservablePoint {
        return this.transform.scale;
    }
    set scale(value: IPointData) {
        this.transform.scale.copyFrom(value);
    }
}
```

```js eval code=false
circle3 = call(() => {
    const { Circle } = Lesson3;
    return new Circle({
        cx: 0,
        cy: 0,
        r: 50,
        fill: 'red',
    });
});
```

```js eval code=false
pivotX2 = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'pivot.x', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval code=false
pivotY2 = Inputs.range([0, 100], { label: 'pivot.y', value: 0, step: 1 });
```

```js eval code=false
scaleX = Inputs.range([0, 5], { label: 'scale.x', value: 1, step: 0.1 });
```

```js eval code=false
scaleY = Inputs.range([0, 5], { label: 'scale.y', value: 1, step: 0.1 });
```

```js eval
call(() => {
    circle3.pivot.x = pivotX2;
    circle3.pivot.y = pivotY2;
    circle3.scale.x = scaleX;
    circle3.scale.y = scaleY;
    circle3.position.x = 100;
    circle3.position.y = 100;
});
```

```js eval code=false
(async () => {
    const { Canvas } = Lesson3;
    const canvas = await Utils.createCanvas(Canvas, 200, 200);
    canvas.appendChild(circle3);

    let id;
    const animate = () => {
        canvas.render();
        id = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();

    unsubscribe(() => {
        cancelAnimationFrame(id);
        canvas.destroy();
    });
    return canvas.getDOM();
})();
```

### Skew

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    get skew(): ObservablePoint {
        return this.transform.skew;
    }
    set skew(value: IPointData) {
        this.transform.skew.copyFrom(value);
    }
}
```

## SceneGraph

A [SceneGraph] is a data structure for organizing and managing 2D/3D virtual scenes and is a directed acyclic graph. SceneGraph provides two major capabilities:

1. describe parent-child relationships
2. automate some complex cascade calculations based on parent-child relationships.

The left panel in Figma shows the scene graph:

![scenegraph in figma](/scenegraph-figma.png)

Imagine we need to build a simple solar system scenario with the following hierarchical relationships:

```bash
solarSystem
   |    |
   |   sun
   |
 earthOrbit
   |    |
   |  earth
   |
 moonOrbit
      |
     moon
```

Use this API description, where `Group` simply inherits the graphics base class and does not need to override the rendering methods:

```ts
const solarSystem = new Group();
const earthOrbit = new Group();
const moonOrbit = new Group();

const sun = new Circle({
    cx: 0,
    cy: 0,
    r: 100,
    fill: 'red',
});
const earth = new Circle({
    cx: 0,
    cy: 0,
    r: 50,
    fill: 'blue',
});
const moon = new Circle({
    cx: 0,
    cy: 0,
    r: 25,
    fill: 'yellow',
});
solarSystem.appendChild(sun);
solarSystem.appendChild(earthOrbit);
earthOrbit.appendChild(earth);
earthOrbit.appendChild(moonOrbit);
moonOrbit.appendChild(moon);
```

### Parent-child relationships

Add `parent` and `children` properties for graphics:

```ts
export abstract class Shape {
    parent: Shape;
    readonly children: Shape[] = [];
}
```

Then we add `append/removeChild` node method. If the child node has already had a parent node added before, it is removed first. The setting of `_parentID` here is related to the implementation of [@pixi/math], which is covered in the last subsection:

```ts{7}
export abstract class Shape {
  appendChild(child: Shape) {
    if (child.parent) {
      child.parent.removeChild(child);
    }
    child.parent = this;
    child.transform._parentID = -1;
    this.children.push(child);

    return child;
  }
}
```

### Traverse scene graph

With the hierarchy in place, we can traverse the entire scene graph using recursion, adding a util method here:

```ts
export function traverse(shape: Shape, callback: (shape: Shape) => void) {
    callback(shape);
    shape.children.forEach((child) => {
        traverse(child, callback);
    });
}
```

During canvas rendering, use the above util methods to render each graphic in turn:

```ts{6}
export class Canvas {
  render() {
    const { hooks } = this.#pluginContext;
    hooks.beginFrame.call();
    this.#shapes.forEach((shape) => {
      traverse(shape, (s) => {
        hooks.render.call(s);
      });
    });
    hooks.endFrame.call();
  }
}
```

### Update transform

In the scene graph, the transformation matrix of a child node in the world coordinate system is computed in the following way:

```bash
child's WorldTransform = parent's WorldTransform
    * child's LocalTransform
```

We complete the update of the transformation matrix before rendering each frame:

```ts{2}
hooks.render.tap((shape) => {
  shape.transform.updateTransform(
    shape.parent ? shape.parent.transform : IDENTITY_TRANSFORM,
  );
  shape.render(this.#device, this.#renderPass, this.#uniformBuffer);
});
```

You might be concerned that if the graph is not transformed, does it still need to be updated every frame? After all, the whole scene graph needs to perform operations on every graph, which is a lot of overhead. We introduced this design pattern in [Lesson 2 - Dirty flag](/guide/lesson-002.html#dirty-flag), but now let's analyze the implementation of [@pixi/math].

Each time a transformation occurs, the translation transformation, for example, just increments the version number `_localID`:

```ts
this.position = new ObservablePoint(this.onChange, this, 0, 0);

protected onChange(): void {
    this._localID++;
}
```

When updating the local transformation matrix, the version number is used to determine if the transformation has not occurred since the last time, otherwise the actual matrix operations are performed. When done, update the version number and force the world transformation matrix to be updated, which is done by resetting `_parentID`:

```ts{3}
updateTransform(parentTransform: Transform): void {
    const lt = this.localTransform;
    if (this._localID !== this._currentLocalID) {
        // 执行实际矩阵运算
        lt.a = this._cx * this.scale.x;
        // ...
        this._currentLocalID = this._localID;
        this._parentID = -1;
    }
    if (this._parentID !== parentTransform._worldID) {
        this._parentID = parentTransform._worldID;
        this._worldID++;
    }
}
```

Remember the new `appendChild` method we added earlier? Since the parent has changed, we need to reset `_parentID` so that the matrix in the world coordinate system is recalculated when the next update comes:

```ts{2}
appendChild(child: Shape) {
    child.transform._parentID = -1;
}
```

This pattern is also used in PIXI.js for operations with high overhead such as calculating the enclosing box.
